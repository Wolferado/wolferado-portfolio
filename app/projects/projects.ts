		description:
			"This is an application that got created for my bachelor's thesis 'Real-time Computer Vision Solution for Latvian Sign Language Recognition'. Contains 4 modules: Home, Recognition, Data Creation, Data Extraction modules, where each is used for different purposes. Solution uses LSTM, RNN, GRU algorithms, new dataset with 4400 videos for machine learning models that are capable to identify and translate 44 signs (letters and words combined) from Latvian Sign Language into digital text. This is my most complex work and it got rewarded with 10 grade in the result and I am proud of it.",

		description:
			"'Krastunda Expedition' is a Unity Game that got created in a team of 6 people during one of the university courses. Main goal is to escape an abandoned planet in under 3 minutes by using keycards, spaceship keys and some notes laying around. It was one of the projects that enticed me to use OOP principles and examine 'Observer' pattern to connect different game logic elements to the specific events. Overall, it was great to work on, 10 grade was also received.",

			"Image Metrics App is capable of evaluating the picture based on 4 metrics: contrast, noise, blur and vignette. Vignette metric logic was created from scratch and can be further explained in the PDF document in the GitHub directory along with its strenghts and weaknesses. App creation was a group project at the university for 'Introduction to Image Processing' course.",
